#  CNN-Based Image Classification Project

This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** for image classification using Python and TensorFlow/Keras. The code is written in a Jupyter Notebook and executed on Google Colab.

## Features

* Image data preprocessing and normalization
* Construction of a CNN model using Keras
* Model training with validation split
* Evaluation and accuracy visualization
* Basic use of layers like Conv2D, MaxPooling2D, Flatten, and Dense

## Requirements

This project runs on Google Colab with the following packages:

* Python 3.x
* TensorFlow
* Keras
* NumPy
* Matplotlib

To run locally, install dependencies using:

```bash
pip install tensorflow matplotlib numpy
```

## ðŸ“Š Model Architecture

A standard CNN model with:

* Convolution layers
* Pooling layers
* Dense fully connected layers

Used for classifying input image data.

## Results

* Model accuracy and loss are plotted using Matplotlib.
* Final accuracy depends on dataset and training parameters.

## Usage

1. Open the notebook in Google Colab.
2. Run all cells step-by-step.
3. Upload your dataset when prompted or modify the data loading section.

## Notes

* Designed for educational purposes.
* You can replace the dataset with any image classification dataset (e.g., MNIST, CIFAR-10).
